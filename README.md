# Security Warning?
For Windows users, since it is not a registered on the Microsoft Store, a security warning will appear only the first time you launch it, but there is no risk, so if the warning appears, just click "More Info" and launch it.


## Mac is unfair for freeware developpers!
Since I don't pay $99 to Apple every year, Mac won't allow you to launch this app without applying an unnecessary security permission.
If you get a security warning and can't launch this app, follow the simple steps as follow:

After installation, just launch the app. If you have a security warning and can't launch it, do this:
(This is required only one time. Next time, Apple won't annoy you)

```
1. Go to Settings and click "Privacy & Security"
2. Click "Open Anyway"
```
