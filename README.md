# Security Warning?
For Windows users, since it is not a registered app on the Microsoft Store, a security warning will appear only the first time you launch it, but there is no risk, so if the warning appears, just click "More Info" and launch it.


## Mac is unfair for freeware developpers!

If you get a security warning and can't launch this app, follow the simple steps as follow:

After installation, just launch the app. If you have a security warning and can't launch it, do this:
(This is required only one time. Next time, Apple won't annoy you)
