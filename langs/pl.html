<h2 id="-">About Security Warnings</h2>
<h3 id="windows-">For Windows Users</h3>
<p>Since Nyan-FA is not yet registered on the Microsoft Store, Windows will display a security warning <strong>only on the first launch</strong>. However, this is absolutely not dangerous at all in any way, so if a warning appears, please click "<strong>More info</strong>" and select "<strong>Run anyway</strong>".</p>
<p><img width="450" height="auto" alt="windows-defender Microsoft" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c774799d-3b4c-4916-9e24-0ee20f649415" /></p>
<h3 id="mac-apple-">For Mac Users (How to Fight Apple's Greed)</h3>
<p>As a free software developer, I don't pay Apple the <b>$99 annual</b> developer fee. Apple tries to <b>throw software from non-contributing developers into the trash</b> (literally, not metaphorically), so on Mac you need to grant security permission to launch this app.</p>
<p>If a security warning appears and you can't launch the app, please follow these simple steps.</p>
<p>First, after installation, try launching the app. If a security warning appears and you can't launch it, follow these steps:
(This operation is only required the first time. After this, not even Apple will be able to bother you anymore.)</p>

<h2 id="nyan-fa-is-safe">Who Made Nyan-FA? Is It Safe?</h2>
<a href="https://beta-japan.com/exis/" target=_blank>I made Nyan-FA.</a><br>
As for what other apps I've created, there's <a href="https://beta-japan.com/" target=_blank>VisiOS</a>, a dark extension, and <a href="https://nyan-8.com/" target=_blank>Nyan-8</a>, a light language learning social media.
  People who are only light or only dark can't be trusted and aren't safe, but <b>when you have both, it's safe</b>.
